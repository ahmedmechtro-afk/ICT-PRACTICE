Very simple project to express what ICT means to me as a student.
 ## What ICT Means to Me
For me, ICT (Information and Communication Technology) is all about data and information.I believe that every technology involving data, information, or communication is part of ICT. It connects the digital world by allowing us to collect, process, and share information efficiently.
